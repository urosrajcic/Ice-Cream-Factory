# Project---Improved
This project is a model for ice cream production and storage. It works by reading txt files and creating ice cream and storage objects in the program that we can modify by console options. And by modifying them we create new txt report files that tell us what changes were made to the storage object and how many ice creams were made. The main console has 8 options: 1st option creates a report txt file for quantity of ingredients in the ingredient storage. 2nd option creates a report txt file for number of ice cremas in the cold storage. 3rd option is the production portion. We can type of ice cream we want to make as well as its quantity, then the program calculates the amount of ingredients needed for production. It takes those ingredients from the ingredient storage and creates ice creams that are stored in the cold storage. And in the end, it creates a report txt file for ice cream made. 4th option prints the quantity of King and Kapri ice cream in the cold storage. 5th option prints the quantity of cocoa in the ingredient storage as well as the number of Coko-moko ice cream that could be made with that amount of cocoa. 6th option orders ingredients and stores them in the igredient storage. 7th option takes ice cream from the cold storage. 8th option ends the program.
